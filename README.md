# Welcome to Zidisha Codebase!

These are the soure files that power [Zidisha.org](http://zidisha.org). Zidisha is a nonprofit organization that enables direct peer-to-peer lending to low-income entrepreneurs in developing countries.  100% of the lender's loan is disbursed directly to the borrower's business. Lenders set their own interest rates and are paid back in weekly installments. Lenders and borrowers can also communicate directly with one another through the website.

You can also follow [@zidishainc](https://twitter.com/ZidishaInc) for updates.
